# Tools

Both tools can be found already built in the Github releases, if you don't want to install all the needed dependencies.

If you want to modify the tools instead you need to install all the Node dependencies and hack your way around.

On every push the binaries are generated by Github actions and if needed a new release should be published with the binaries.

## npm usage

The web files located in src/websrc/ will be minified, combined (css, js), gzipped, converted to byte arrays, and these are placed in src/webh/ when the builder is run.
To run the builder script with npm do as follows:

1. change directory into the webfilesbuilder folder
2. execute `npm install` in the webfilesbuilder folder to install the npm dependancies (listed in package.json)
3. execute `npm start` to run the web files builder script (gulpfile.js)
4. now you can compile the firmware using PlatformIO

## webfilesbuilder

The `webfilesbuilder` executable that you can get from the releases should be copied in the `tools/webfilesbuilder/` folder and run from there as it looks for files in specific folders relative to that location.
